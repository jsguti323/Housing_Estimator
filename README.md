# Housing Estimator
## Overview
For our final project, our group decided to build multiple machine learning models that attempt to predict the median price of various houses in California depending on various house-related features such as location, total rooms, and bedrooms, as well as neighborhood-related features such as median income of nearby homeowners, the number of homes within a specified range, and population within a specified range. Regarding machine learning, we decided to apply multiple models and we will compare the outcomes of each model. These models are random forest classification, neural networking, and multivariate linear regression. We will store our database on AWS. Our communication protocols include meeting twice a week via Google Meet on Monday and Wednesday before class, as well as additional meetings later in the week if needed.
